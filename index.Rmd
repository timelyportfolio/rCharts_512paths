## NY Times [512 Paths to the White House](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/02/us/politics/paths-to-the-white-house.html?_r=1&)
### Recreated in [R](http://r-project.org) with [rCharts](http://ramnathv.github.io/rCharts) and [slidify](http://ramnathv.github.io/slidify)
<br/>
_ _ _
**I claim absolutely no credit for this visualization, which I consider one of the most instructive I have ever seen.  If anybody believes this to be not fair use, I will take it down immediately.**

We will provide a detailed tutorial below to go from the NYT feature to something we can render from R, but for now you can just download the rCharts_512paths directory from [Github](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/rCharts_512paths/tree/gh-pages/rCharts_512paths).  Set your working directory (setwd) to your download location.  Then simply run the following couple lines of code in R.

```{r results='asis'}
#if you have not installed slidify, slidifyLibraries, or rCharts
#require(devtools)
#install_github('slidify', 'ramnathv', ref = 'dev')
#install_github('rCharts', 'ramnathv')
#install_github('slidifyLibraries', 'ramnathv', ref = 'dev') # optional

#setwd("rCharts_512paths")

require(rCharts)
#get data from downloaded NYT tsv and inject in through params
data <- read.delim(file = "data/states.tsv")
p1 <- rCharts$new()
p1$setLib('./libraries/widgets/x512paths')
p1$field('lib', 'x512paths')
p1$set( data = toJSONArray( data ) )
p1
```
```{r,results='asis',echo=FALSE}
p1$print( 'g-chart' )
```

### Steps to Accomplish
1.  **Create a new directory x512paths** anywhere you like.  We choose x512paths, since shiny does not like paths that start with a number.  Within this new x512paths, set up two subdirectories: **external** and **layouts**.    
2.  **Save** [iframe.html](http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2012/10/12/electoral-calculator/7feadbc7606af9ce0e5d242e1ba75fd53717da7d/iframe.html) from the NYT **into the new x512paths/layouts directory from step 1**.  This isolates the visualization, so we can use it for our template.    
3.  **Rename iframe.html to chart.html**.    
3.  **Open chart.html** from step 2 in a text editor.    
4.  **Copy everything between the <style></style> tags** into a **new text file** that we will name **nyt_512.css** and **save in x512paths/external** created in step 1.    
4.  **Delete everything in chart.html** except for the portion    
    <pre class="html">   
      div class="g-controls"    
      ...    
        function diagonal(d) {    
        var x0 = d.source.x, y0 = y(d.source.depth),    
            x1 = d.target.x, y1 = y(d.target.depth);    
        if (x0 < x1) x0 += w(d.target.probability) / 2;    
        else if (x0 > x1) x0 -= w(d.target.probability) / 2;    
        return "M" + x0 + "," + y0    
            + "C" + x0 + "," + (y0 + y1) / 2    
            + "," + x1 + "," + (y0 + y1) / 2    
            + "," + x1 + "," + y1;    
        }    
            
      })();    
      \<\/script\>
    </pre>
5.  **Change the line**
    <pre>
    d3.tsv("states.tsv", function(error, states) {    
    </pre>
    to    
    <pre>
    d3.tsv("http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rCharts_512paths/data/states.tsv", function(error, states) {    
    </pre>
5.  **Save** [d3.v3.min.js](http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js) into x512paths/external created in step 1.
6.  **Create a new** text file that we will call **config.yml** and save in the x512paths from step 1.
    <pre>  
    x512paths:    
        css: [external/nyt_512.css]    
        jshead: [external/d3.v3.min.js]    
        cdn:    
          jshead:    
            - http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js
    </pre>
7.  Now is a good time to check your directory structure.  It should look like the picture below.    
  ![picture of directory structure](images/dir_struct.png)
8.  Try to rerun the code above in R, but change the
```{r,eval=FALSE}
p1$setLib('./libraries/widgets/x512paths')
```
to
```{r,eval=FALSE}
p1$setLib( 'pathtoyournewdirectory/x512paths' )
```
so your couple of lines of code should look something like this.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
require(rCharts)
#get data from downloaded NYT tsv and inject in through params
data <- read.delim(file = "data/states.tsv")
p1 <- rCharts$new()
#make sure to change this path to your newly created masterpiece
p1$setLib('pathtoyournewdirectory/x512paths')
p1$field('lib', 'x512paths')
p1$set( data = toJSONArray( data ) )
p1
```


As a disclaimer, I made some unnecessary adjustments not documented above.  These were primarily for politeness.  The only changes to the code remove dependencies on NYT for the d3 and svg/png graphics.  Also, as an illustration of how we can do this, data is provided from R rather than the original d3.tsv method.  If you are interested in these changes, feel free to explore the [code](http://github.com/timelyportfolio/rCharts_512paths).
